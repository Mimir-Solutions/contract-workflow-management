== Workflow Architecture

=== Abstract

The intention of this architecture is to allow users to execute transaction using contracts they have approved.
Developers define and store their protocol as a series of function calls to a series of contract addresses.
Users approve the developer's protocol by importing the definition into their own registry.
Transactions are executed from a front controller by sending the ID for the define protocol.
The front controller looks up or determines the user's registry address.
The front controller retrieves the specifics of the protocol defintion from the user's registry.
The front controller executes the retrieved functions on the retrived contract addresses.

There is a more detailed explanation of the architecture and maintenance process in the rest of this document.

=== Vocabulary

* Step - Function selector to execute.
** Step Id - Fuction Selector stored as bytes4.
* Step Executor - Contract address on whoch to execute a Step.
** Step Executor ID - Result of bitwise XOR operation of Step function selector and Step Execuotr address stored as bytes32.
* Job - an array of Stpes in the order of execution.
** Job ID - Result of bitwise XOR of Steps in the order of executtion stored as a bytes4.
* WorkerSet - An array of Step Executors stored in the order of execution for a Workflow.
** Workerset ID - The result of a bitwise XOR operation of Step Executor IDs in the order of execution.
* Workflow - Paired values of a Job and Workset.
** Workjflow ID - Result of bitwise XOR operation of Job ID and WorkerSet ID.

=== Data model

WorkflowID gets a tuple of the Job and WorkerSet to simplify call.
This processes the nessecary look ups internally.
It is also possible to import a workflows be reversing the process, using with function selectors or signatures.

*Workflow could be consolidated into a struct*

[source,solidity]
----
mapping( bytes32 => bytes4 ) workflowIDForJobID
mapping( bytes32 => bytes32 ) workflowIDForWorkerSetID
mapping( bytes4 => bytes4[] ) jobIDforSteps
mapping( byes32 => bytes32[] ) worksetIDForStepExecutory
----
The rest of the data structure is stored as stated to and can be updated as stated.
There will be encoding, view, and storage operations.
This is being done because storage operations might need to be granularized to remain under the gas limit.
The granularized storage might not be needed as fundamentally, a Workflow is an atomic unit of work.
There exists potential to define Workflows of Workflows.
But that is likely best handled by simply defining a new workflow merging the Steps.
Or by developing a new Step Executor that wraps the workflow.
This could be done by developing a front controller that call several workflows.

There is no need to store just a Step or just a Step Executor.
These are only relevant in the context of a Workflow.
